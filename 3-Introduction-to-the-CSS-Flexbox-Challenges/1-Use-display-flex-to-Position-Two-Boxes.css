/* CSS allows for Applied Visual Design with a few properties. For text, 'text-align' is one way to adjust how text
 appears in the layout of a page and within its containers. Text can be aligned to the right, left, or centered as well
 as "justified" which creates even lines until the last line falls short of the right margin. */

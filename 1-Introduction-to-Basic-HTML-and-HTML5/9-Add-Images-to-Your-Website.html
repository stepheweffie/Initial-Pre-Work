<!-- Websites include images inside 'img' tags which are self enclosing and do not require a closing tag. An alt attribute
 displays text or is left blank and its content becomes visible if the image fails to load. Empty alt attributes are
 a best practice for purely decorative images. These attributes do not contain special characters usually. -->
